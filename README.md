# Retrofit Usage 

**LastKnight** is an Android application developed to demonstrate modern best practices in mobile app development using Kotlin. The main goal of this project is to show how to efficiently fetch, display, and manage movie data from a remote API using Retrofit, while also providing a seamless user experience with local data caching and a "Watch Later" feature.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:

- Implemented network operations with Retrofit to fetch popular movies from an external API.  
- Designed a local database using Room to cache movie data and allow offline access.  
- Created a "Watch Later" list, enabling users to save movies for future viewing.  
- Applied the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.  
- Used LiveData and ViewModel for reactive UI updates and lifecycle management.  
- Built a modern user interface with Fragments and RecyclerView for smooth navigation and data presentation.

The purpose of this project is to provide a clear example of how to combine remote and local data sources in an Android app, following clean architecture principles and using widely adopted libraries and tools.
